# disease-symptom-dashboard
Dashboard that allows users to explore the relationships between symptoms and diseases

## Tab 1: Disease Prediction
Allows users to enter in their symptoms. One of 4 machine learning models may be selected in order to make the prediction. 
Once the user hits 'Done' the model will run and output a predicted disease based on the given symptoms.

## Tab 2: Sankey Diagram
Users may enter in one or more diseases. A sankey diagram will be generated mapping these diseases to their known symptoms. 
This allows users to visualize possible connections between different diseases through shared symptoms.

## Tab 3: Heat Map
Users may choose a disease from the dropdown menu. A heat map of the USA will be generated which shows the relative 
prevalance of that disease in each state.

## Tab 4: Disease Prevalance
Users may choose a disease from the dropdown menu. A dot map of the USA will be generated which shows the prevalance 
of that disease across different counties in the USA.
